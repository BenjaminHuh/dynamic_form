# Dynamic Form

Dynamic Form generator built using React.

Takes in JSON-like data and dynamically creates a form. Upon submit, it creates a JS Object and renders the object representation on the screen. 

The actual JS Object is also displayed on the console.

To run, clone the repo and open the index.html file with your favorite browser.
